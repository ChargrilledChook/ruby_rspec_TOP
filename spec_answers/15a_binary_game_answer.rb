# The file order to complete this lesson:

# 1. Familarize yourself with the four lib/15 files.
#    - lib/15_binary_main
#    - lib/15a_binary_game
#    - lib/15b_binary_search (which is based on 14_find_number)
#    - lib/15c_random_numer
# 2. Read the comments in spec/15b_binary_search_spec
# 3. Complete spec/15a_binary_game_spec

# As noted above, the files for this lesson (#15) build on the TDD files
# from #14. The FindNumber class is now called BinarySearch, which is a more
# accurate description.

# This lesson has a new class called BinaryGame. This BinaryGame class uses
# the BinarySearch class and visualizes how a binary search works.

# The focus of this lesson is unit testing and will provide general guidelines on determining what methods need to be tested.

# In general, you have 3 types of methods:
# 1. Command - These are methods that performs an action and/or has a side effect
# 2. Query - These are methods that returns a value.
# 3. Script - These are methods that call other methods, usually in a specific order.

# Methods that need to be tested:
# 1. Public Command Method
# 2. Public Query Method
# 3. Command Method inside a Public Script Method
# 4. Query Method inside a Public Script Method
# 5. Any method that sends a command message to another class.

# EXPLAIN 3 & 4 -> LOOK AT TIMATO'S RESPONSE FOR IDEAS
# WHAT ABOUT PRIVATE LOOPING SCRIPT METHODS???

# There are a handful of methods that you do not need to test.
# 1. You do not need to test #initialize if it is only creating instance variables. This can cause the test to be fragile, breaking anytime an instance variable name is changed. If you choose to call methods inside the initialize method, you will need to stub each method for every instance in the tests.

# 2. Methods that only contain 'puts' or 'gets' because they are well-tested in the standard ruby library.

# 3. Private methods do not need to be tested because they should have test coverage in public methods

# Test behaviours, not implementation.
# Unit testing is understood as testing small parts of the code in isolation, e.g. testing some classâ€™s methods, maybe using some stubs/mocks to strip dependencies.
# private methods will be tested through public entry points. Once again, unit testing is not about testing every method in isolation.

# Unit Testing Summary
# Incoming Query -> Assert the result
# Incoming Command -> Assert the direct public side effects
# Outgoing Command -> Expect to send

# INSERT -> SCRIPT EXPLANATION

# In addition, you do not need to test #initialize if it is only creating
# instance variables. This can cause the test to be fragile, breaking anytime
# an instance variable name is changed. If you choose to call methods inside the
# initialize method, you will need to stub each method for every instance in the
# tests.

# That leaves ??? methods to test
