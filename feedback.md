* Advantage to passing String.new as opposed to a string literal?
* Let blocks interfering with the 'story' of a test - DRY is less important for testing

* Updating implicit subject is slightly confusing
* Less is more - slightly too many ideas

# 3

* Is the compound example recommended or not? Unclear from previous line about not combining tests

# 4

* Predicate method style names (with ?) for hash keys? Haven't seen before. Not necessarily wrong
