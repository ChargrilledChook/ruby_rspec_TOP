# 1

* Advantage to passing String.new as opposed to a string literal?
* Let blocks interfering with the 'story' of a test - DRY is less important for testing

# 2

* Unsure about comment about nested order? Appears in written order to me
* Updating implicit subject is slightly confusing
* Less is more - slightly too many ideas
* Probably shouldn't show the wrong way (implicit subject) first

# 3

* Is the compound example recommended or not? Unclear from previous line about not combining tests

# 4

* Predicate method style names (with ?) for hash keys? Haven't seen before. Not necessarily wrong

# 5

* More focused (++) but slightly more info in the top comment.

# 6

* Side rant about rspec, but having eq, eql and equal do three different things is ridiculous
* Lesson good though

# 7

# 8

# 9

* 9 mentions matcher scope but not what that actually is. Within a describe block? just within a block

# 10

* Structure of various components? context, describe, let, subject, custom matcher etc
